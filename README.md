# Hi there 👋  

I’m Yogesh! A frontend developer with 8+ years of experience, specializing in React, Next.js, and modern CSS techniques. I build high-performance, accessible, and scalable web applications.  

Recently, I’ve been diving into blockchain development, learning to build secure and gas-efficient smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks. Through hands-on projects and bootcamps, I’m gaining expertise in Solidity, Hardhat, and Web3 integrations.

## 🚀 What I Do  

### **Frontend Development**  
I create fast, user-friendly, and accessible web experiences by leveraging modern frameworks and best practices. My expertise includes:  
- **React, Next.js, TypeScript** – Building scalable and performant SPAs and SSR applications.  
- **Advanced CSS & UI Engineering** – Using SCSS, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap for pixel-perfect designs.  
- **Performance Optimization** – Improving Web Vitals, lazy loading, and code splitting for fast-loading websites.  

### **Blockchain Development (Learning & Exploring)**  
I’m currently learning and working on:  
- **Solidity & Smart Contracts** – Writing secure and optimized contracts on Ethereum.  
- **Hardhat & Foundry** – Developing and testing blockchain applications.  
- **Viem & Wagmi** – Integrating smart contracts into frontend applications.
